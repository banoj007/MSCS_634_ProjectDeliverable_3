# Deliverable 3: Classification, Clustering, and Pattern Mining
Project Overview
This deliverable focuses on three major machine learning tasks — classification, clustering, and association rule mining — applied to the given dataset (CarPrice_Assignment.csv). The aim is to build predictive models, identify meaningful customer segments, and discover useful patterns in the data.

# 1. Classification Models
We developed and evaluated the following classification models:

Decision Tree Classifier

k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)

Support Vector Machine (SVM) (for comparison)

Hyperparameter Tuning
Hyperparameter tuning was performed using GridSearchCV on the Decision Tree Classifier.

Parameters tuned included:

max_depth (Tree depth)

min_samples_split (Minimum samples required to split a node)

criterion (Gini vs. Entropy)

Model Evaluation Metrics
We evaluated model performance using:

Confusion Matrix — to assess correct and incorrect predictions

ROC Curve and AUC score — to visualize separability of classes

Accuracy & F1-Score — to balance precision and recall for fair evaluation
# 2. Clustering Model
We implemented K-Means Clustering to identify patterns in car pricing and market segments.

Steps Taken
Applied feature scaling (StandardScaler) for improved clustering performance

Determined optimal number of clusters using Elbow Method and Silhouette Score

Visualized clusters in 2D space using PCA (Principal Component Analysis)

Insights from Clustering
The clusters revealed price-based market segments

Grouped cars based on engine size, horsepower, and brand positioning

Identified premium vs. budget vehicle categories
# 3. Association Rule Mining
We applied the Apriori Algorithm to identify rules between car features and pricing categories.

Key Findings
Rules showed strong relationships between brand, fuel type, and price range

Certain combinations of engine type and body style were strongly associated with higher or lower prices

These patterns could be applied in:

Marketing strategies (targeting specific segments)

Inventory management (stocking popular configurations)
# 4. Real-World Applications
Car Manufacturers can use classification models to predict pricing categories for new models.

Dealerships can identify target customer segments through clustering.

E-commerce platforms can recommend cars based on association rules from historical sales.
# 5. Challenges and How They Were Addressed
Challenge	Solution
Handling missing values	Imputed using median and mode depending on feature type
Class imbalance in classification	Used class_weight='balanced' for fair training
Determining optimal cluster number	Applied Elbow method and validated with Silhouette score
Apriori performance on large feature sets	Limited to most frequent attributes to optimize computation
# 6. Conclusion
The integration of classification, clustering, and pattern mining techniques provided a holistic view of the dataset. By combining predictive modeling, segmentation, and rule discovery, we uncovered both short-term actionable insights (like marketing and sales strategies) and long-term strategic benefits (like product positioning in the market).
